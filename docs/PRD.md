### Mako LWIR

The Mako longwave-infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imager is an airborne whiskbroom
system delivering 128 channels that span approximately 7.5–13.5 µm. The COMEX
campaign is the primary public reference for Mako data products, providing
Level-2S radiance cubes in ENVI format (microflick radiance units across all 128
bands) together with Level-3 brightness temperature (BTEMP) and atmospheric
characterization (ACE) products derived from the same acquisitions.
