# Architecture Decisions

This index tracks Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project. ADRs capture the context, decisions, and consequences behind major changes so future contributors understand why the system evolved in a particular direction. See [docs/adr/README.md](adr/README.md) for guidance on naming, status values, and workflow.
