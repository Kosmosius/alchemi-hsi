# ALCHEMI Overview

ALCHEMI (Atmosphere-aware Lab-to-scene Contrastive Hyperspectral Embeddings for Material Identity) is a physics-aware, any-sensor hyperspectral foundation model. The library provides reusable components for ingesting sensor data, applying physics-based transformations, training multitask models, and evaluating across solids and gas scenarios.

The detailed system specification, including physics contracts, data schemas, and evaluation protocols, is maintained in the LaTeX design document at `docs/design/alchemi_design.tex`. This index will expand as implementation proceeds to link tutorials, quickstarts, and API guides.
