### Mako LWIR

The Mako airborne LWIR hyperspectral imager supplies 128 whiskbroom channels
covering roughly 7.5–13.5 µm. Public distribution today centers on the COMEX
archive, which publishes Level-2S radiance cubes as 128-band ENVI files in
microflick radiance units, alongside Level-3 brightness-temperature (BTEMP) and
atmospheric characterization experiment (ACE) products derived from the same
collections.
