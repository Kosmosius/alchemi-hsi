# Spectra experiments (experimental)

The `spectra` package contains experimental and legacy SpectralEarth-based
workflows that live alongside the core `alchemi` library. Code here is provided
for research and prototyping and is not part of the supported application
programming interface. The maintained, production-ready components live under
`src/alchemi/`, which is the primary API surface for consumers.
