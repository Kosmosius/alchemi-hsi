# Spectra experiments

This package contains experimental or legacy SpectralEarth-driven explorations that accompany the main Alchemi library. The supported, production-ready APIs live under [`src/alchemi/`](../alchemi/), and changes in `spectra` may evolve independently without the same stability guarantees.
